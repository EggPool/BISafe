# Bismuth Offline Address Generator

A Safe (offline) Bismuth address generator to make your cold wallet.  

All code is JS only, not minified, and does no xml-rpc nor external includes.  

You can run this on an air gaped computer, from within a tails or ubuntu usb key.

## Usage

- Get the repo
- Load index.html into your browser
- Gather entropy
- Generates Cold Bis Address  
  (Takes a while, about 1 min)
- Save keys and address on safe usb key or print


## Current state

Proof of concept.  

Please test and validate results with a regular wallet install.  
It's the first raw proof of concept, with new libs, new code, quick mashup of other existing code.  
It's not clean nor production ready, do NOT trust it yet to store your BIS.  

WIP, much more to come.
