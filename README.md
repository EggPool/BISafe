# BisAfe

A safe, Html wallet for Bismuth Cryptocurrency.
Be safe!

See also the [Offline Bismuth Address gernerator](./Generator/Readme.md), for cold wallets.


## Project Goal

To handle all of the crypto client side, in javascript.


## Benefits

- Streamlined HTML interface
- Skins and translations
- Usable from github, from a local computer
- Embeddable as a mobile app
- Private key in local storage only, import/export.

- Also allows cold wallets that only connect to a node when sending BIS, and does not share private key.
